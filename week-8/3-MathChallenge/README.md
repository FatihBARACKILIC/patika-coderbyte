# Math Challenge

Have the function MathChallenge(num) read num which will be an integer. Your program should return the smallest integer that when squared has a length equal to num. For example: if num is 6 then your program should output 317 because 317^2 = 100489 while 316^2 = 99856 which does not have a length of six.

```bash
Input: 2
Output: 4
```

```bash
Input: 1
Output: 0
```

```JavaScript
function MathChallenge(num) { 

  // code goes here  
  return num; 

}
   
// keep this function call here 
console.log(MathChallenge(readline()));
```
